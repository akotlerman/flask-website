# Shura Kotlerman's Personal Flask Website

This repo is a Flask App derived from [https://jackstouffer.com/flask-foundation/](https://jackstouffer.com/flask-foundation/). From the README:

> Flask Foundation is a solid foundation for flask applications, built with best practices, that you can easily construct your website/webapp off of. Flask Foundation is different from most Flask frameworks as it does not assume anything about your development or production environments. Flask Foundation is platform agnostic in this respect.

My blog is currently under development [here](http://shura-kot.herokuapp.com/topics/) and uses a modified version of the [Flask-FlatPages](https://github.com/Flask-FlatPages/Flask-FlatPages) plugin. I have a lot future work for this site including:

+ Integrating the [Flam3](https://github.com/akotlerman/flam3_animation_generator) algorithm.
+ Writing science fiction
+ Teach and bog about other interests such as Math and Python.

## Running this Flask App

The command to run the app is in Procfile for compatibility with Heroku.
